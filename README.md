# Challenge: Energy vs. Shannon Marine Life

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Skills:** Ecology, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Data Analysis, Hydrodynamics, Marine Biology

## Summary:

As Ireland works towards reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, hydroelectric power has emerged as a common alternative. For decades, the Irish government has harnessed the Shannon River to generate sustainable energy. However, this energy prduction poses a significant threat to the river's marine life. Dams and hydroelectric turbines disrupt fish migration patterns, marine food chains and the water quality; putting several species at risk. Your challenge is to reduce the impact of the energy industry on the Shannon's aquatic ecosystem.

## Background

Marine life in Ireland has been declining steadily over the past number of years. One of the causes of this is the shift towards renewable energy sources. Hydroelectricity presents Ireland with a unique opportunity for self-sufficiency in green energy production.

Since the 1920s, the Shannon River has served as a crucial source of electricity for the country. However, the extensive use of hydroelectric power has led to significant ecological consequences. The construction of dams and the operation of hydroelectric turbines disrupt natural habitats, food chains and interfere with fish migration patterns. As Ireland navigates its transition to renewable energy, it is essential to balance these efforts with the preservation of our marine life.

## Objectives

Your challenge is to develop innovative strategies, products, or services aimed at reducing the negative effects of hydroelectric energy production on local marine ecosystems. These may include gathering and/or analysing data related to fish populations, food sources and water quality.

Alternativly, physical solutions that can safeguard marine life during the energy production process could be used, such as specialized nets or filters that prevent marine life from being harmed during water intake and turbine operations could be used. Furthermore, you could enhance an existing solutions, such as fish cannons and fish ladders.

## Potential Considerations

You may (but are not required to) consider the following:

- **Location:** Are there specific areas along the Shannon River where hydroelectric energy production poses a greater risk to local ecosystems?

- **Size:** What dimensions should the water intake gaps ensure fish aren't being trapped?

- **Maintenance:** Does the maintenance of hydroelectric equipment/fish protection tools contribute to further disturbances for fish populations? If so, what strategies can be implemented to mitigate this disruption?
